# Export and Import the ATA Configuration
The configuration of ATA is stored in the "SystemProfile" collection in the database.
This collection is backed up every hour by the ATA Center service to files called: "SystemProfile_*timestamp*.json". The most recent 10 versions are stored.
This is located in a subfolder called "Backup". In the default ATA installed location it can be found here:  *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Center\Backup\SystemProfile_*timestamp*.json*. 

**Note**: It is recommended that you back up this file somewhere when making major changes to ATA.

It is possible to restore all the settings by running the following command:

`mongoimport.exe --db ATA --collection SystemProfile --file "<SystemProfile.json backup file>" --upsert`
